# Cosmic Synaptic Predictor â€” Live Demo (Single-file Web App)

This ZIP contains a single HTML file `index.html` that runs entirely in your browser. It simulates the look & feel of the "WHITE HACKER AI v4.2" predictions and demonstrates:
- Frequency + Recency based prediction heuristic
- Size (BIG/SMALL), Color (ðŸŸ¢/ðŸ”´/ðŸŸ£), Number prediction, and Confidence %
- A demo 3x-martingale tracker stored in-memory for the demo session
- "Predict Now" and "Next Prediction" buttons to simulate period progression

## How to use
1. Unzip and open `index.html` in a browser (no server required), or host the file on GitHub Pages for a live site.
2. Paste your last 10 results in the textarea (comma-separated) and click **Predict Now**.
3. Click **Next Prediction** to simulate advancing one period (it will slide the window using the last generated number).
4. The app is educational and intentionally simple â€” do **not** treat it as guaranteed gambling strategy.

## To host on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repository and upload the `index.html` file.
2. In repository settings enable GitHub Pages from the main branch. Your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Notes
- This is a demo meant for learning and visualization. It is not financial advice.
